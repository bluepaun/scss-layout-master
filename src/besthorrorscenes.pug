        h4 An ever growing collection featuring some of the best scenes in horror.

        p “Best Horror Scenes” is a collection of scenes I feel are some of the most affecting in horror. Some may be simple black cat scares, others may be more subdued or nuanced. Many come from films that aren't necessarily “horror” but have elements or threads of horror.

                p This film flew under the radar for me until a few years ago. I’d heard about it several times and knew it was considered a classic, but, to be completely transparent, I sometimes have a tough time convincing myself to watch older films for fear that they just won’t hold up well. Particularly films in the Horror genre.
                p While Tourist Trap is undeniably a product of its time, it’s an important film in the annals of Horror and is often legitimately creepy. I mean, murderous mannequins? EEK! Once, when I asked, “Why do people put concrete deer in their front yard? Is it to ward off other deer?” my friend Toto replied, “Would you go into a house that had a bunch of mannequins in the front yard?”
                p No. I most definitely would not.
